/** \brief Simple thread-safe class for a object that needs to inform
  * other objects of changes to its contents..
  * Just helps determine when a Publisher has an updated "publication" in store for 
  * a given subscriber.
  * A Publisher keeps track of its current publication number, and also keeps track of the 
  * latest issue that was consumed (Locked) by the subscriber.
  * This way, it can tell the subscriber which issue was the last consumed.
  *
  * \Notes:
  *    For a simple use of the class, a subscriber does:
  *        PublisherDerivateClass publisher();
  *        Publisher::SubscriberID subscriberID= publisher->Subscribe();  // Subscribe to a publisher
  *        // In application event loop
  *        if (publisher->HasNews(subscriberID))
  *        {
  *            if (publisher->LockNews(subscriberID));  // Informs the publisher and locks the mutex; 
  *			   {
  *                ... // Process the publisher news
  *                publisher->GetIssueDerivateClassMethod(latestIssueNumber);
  *			       publisher->UnlockNews(subscriberID);  // Frees the lock on the news.
  *            }
  *        }
  *
  *    Since some publishers also have non-incremental Publication ID, a more complex subscriber could:
  *        PublisherDerivateClass publisher();
  *        Publisher::SubscriberID subscriberID= publisher->Subscribe();  // Subscribe to a publisher
  *
  *        // In application event loop
  *        if (publisher->HasNews())
  *        {
  *            Publisher::IssueID latestIssue = publisher->GetCurrentIssueID();
  *            Publisher::IssueID issueOnHand =  publisher->GetConsumedIssueID();             
  *            Publisher::IssueID issueRequested =  issueOnHand;             
  *            ... // Process all of the back issues 
  *            do 
  *			   {
  *                issueRequested++;  // Request the next issue.
  *                if (publisher->LockNews(subscriberID, issueRequested);  // Informs the publisher and locks the mutex; 
  *			       {
  *                     publisher->GetIssueDerivateClassMethod(issueRequested);
  *			            publisher->UnlockNews(subscriberID);  // Frees the lock on the news.
  *				   }
  *            } while (issueRequested != lastIssue);
  *        }
  *
  *        ....
  *        // You may reuse the IssueID to request a re-issue from the publisher.
  *        publisher->GetIssueDerivateClassMethod(issueOnHandNumber);
