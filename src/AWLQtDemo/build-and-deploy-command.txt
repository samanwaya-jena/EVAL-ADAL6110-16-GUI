## These commands will work on a Windows environment to build and create and
installer for Windows. 
## Right now x64 is supported for sure (because x64 .dlls are included)
## Make sure you have all the dependencies installed and a working msvc
runtime environment to build the project 
### *** with the current installation, msvc 2015 and more recent versions are suggested ***

## Build 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
